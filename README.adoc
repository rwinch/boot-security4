= Spring Boot 1.2.x with Spring Security 4

Simple example of using Spring Security 4 with Spring Boot 1.2.x with Maven.

The key is to use the Spring Security Starter and override the spring-security.version property. For example:

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
	<!-- ... -->

	<spring-security.version>4.0.1.RELEASE</spring-security.version>
</properties>

<dependencies>
	<!-- ... -->

	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
----

If you are migrating from Spring Security 3.2.x, then the same http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/4.0.x/reference/htmlsingle/#m3to4[migration steps] are involved as a standard Spring Security 3.2.x to Spring Security 4.x migration.
